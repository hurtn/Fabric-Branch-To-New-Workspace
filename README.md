This simple code demonstrates how to programatically clone a workspace using Git (AzDO) and assigning it to a new git branch, for the purposes of feature branch development in Microsoft Fabric. This is a more "manual" way of implementing the recently released [branch out to new workspace functionality](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-new-branching-capabilities-in-fabric-git-integration/). 

Note this does not include cloning of data, shortcuts, managed private endpoints, connections, permissions or shortcuts. It should be used for demonstration purposes only.
